This is a Web Application built with `JavaScript` and bundled with `webpack`, it utilizes the `luxon` library to display the local date & time,

## Built With

- HTML

  - `ul` Unordered List (To list out books items on the page)
  - HTML `form`
  - `input` attributes; `placeholder`

- Java Script
- Implemented DOM manipulation in various parts of the project to make page dynamic.
- JS `Objects`, `Arrays`, & `Object Arrays` to store data of similar items.
- Implement the use of Arrow Functions `=>` and `{destructure}` methods to match the modern conceptions.
- Implemented `array.forEach()`, through the course of the project to loop through `objects` in the `Objects Array`; thus making it possible to manipulate the objects and produce desired result.
- Made use of `if Statements` to match specific use cases.
- Made use of the`FormData` web API to get the form value
- Implement the use of `eventListeners` to make 'add' & 'delete' buttons functional.
- The `JSON` API `stringify` & `parse` was implemented, to enable JS Objects to be used on windows local storage.
- The `localStorage` `set()` & `get()` methods were used to store and retrieve books data.
- Made use of the `HTMLCollection` API with DOM selector `document.querySelectorAll()` to manipulate a list of elements with same class.
- Implement `JS - Class` to make an Object oriented programming (OOP)

* Load `DateTime` from `luxon` library.
